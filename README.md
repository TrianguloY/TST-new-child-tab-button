# TST new child tab button

This is an addon for [TST (Tree Style Tabs)](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) that shows an icon next to the 'x' in each tab. When clicked, a new tab will be created as a child of that tab.

Created because I wanted a very quick way to choose between opening a child or an independent tab (and without remembering shortcuts). More info here: https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/2926
